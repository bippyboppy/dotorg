#+title: Vasocomputation
#+AUTHOR: oddfeed
Vasocomputation refers to the idea that blood vessels in the body, particularly in the brain, do more than passively transport blood; they may actively participate in information processing. This concept suggests that blood vessels can dynamically respond to neural activity and potentially influence it by regulating blood flow based on the energy demands of neurons in real time. In essence, this would mean that blood vessels could play a role in “computing” or modulating neural activity through changes in blood supply, thus affecting brain function.

Vasocomputation is an emerging area of research in neuroscience, and while it remains mostly theoretical, it explores how vascular systems might interact with neural networks, especially given that the brain’s energy demands and blood flow are tightly coupled. This could have implications for understanding brain health, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain-computer interfaces, potentially offering a new layer of insight into how information processing occurs within biological systems.
