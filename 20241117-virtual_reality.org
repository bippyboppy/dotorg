Working in vr seems to have pretty big advantages such as allowing social working or priming your brain to a certain set of conditions, as I'm writing this I'm sat in a cabin in effectively the middle of nowhere, not only that but the use of coworking is long and documented, the reason a lot of people work in starbucks is because it does pretty significantly improve not just productivity but the actual quality of your work.
