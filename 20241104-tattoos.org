* Aftercare
** Second skin
second skin is a wrap product usually applied after the tattoo, it has several major advantages
1. Due to keeping the plasma on the tattoo it speeds up healing (reducing it by 30-60%)
2. It keeps it covered for the first 24 hours (which is when you're most likely to get infected)[fn:1]
3. It keeps it hydrated without smothering it.
4. If you apply a new second skin it keeps bacteria off your tattoo for the first 5 days

** Dove Beauty Bar

** Aloe Vera


[fn:1]after 24 hours you should take it off, clean the tattoo, dry it, then reapply new second skin for an additional 3-5 days.
